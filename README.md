# Resolving Community Parking Issues: An IoT
Enabled Statistical and Deep Learning Approach
for Enhanced Urban Parking Management

Urban communities face significant parking challenges, impacting drivers' time, fuel consumption, and causing frustration and environmental harm. Addressing these issues through effective parking management not only mitigates negative impacts but also presents a profit opportunity. In the context of smart cities and interconnected vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) play crucial roles. This work proposes an IoT-enabled smart parking management simulation framework with a real-time negotiation system. The framework considers driver preferences and parking lot occupancy, enhancing decision-making. Predictive learning and a dynamic pricing policy based on seasonal ARIMA models maximize profit, optimizing traffic flow and parking availability.
